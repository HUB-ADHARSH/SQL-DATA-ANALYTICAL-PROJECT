# SQL-DATA-ANALYTICAL-PROJECT
SQL DATA ANALYTICS for productive and auditable worflow

---

A modular SQL project designed to explore, analyze, and report on structured data using best practices in query design, performance tracking, and layered analysis. Each script builds upon the previous, forming a reproducible and auditable workflow.

---

## üß≠ Objectives

- Initialize and explore the database schema  
- Perform dimensional and range-based data profiling  
- Conduct analytical deep-dives: magnitude, ranking, time-based change, cumulative trends  
- Segment data and analyze part-to-whole relationships  
- Generate final reports for key business entities (customers, products)
